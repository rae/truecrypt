Note that a TrueCrypt file container (even though it contains a virtual encrypted disk) is actually just like any normal file. Therefore, it can be, for example, easily renamed, moved, or copied as any normal file. For more information, see the chapter Beginner's Tutorial in the TrueCrypt User Guide.\n\nAre you sure you want to encrypt the entire device/partition?</string>

It should not be easy to guess. A good password is a random combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters, such as @ ^ = $ * + etc. We recommend choosing a password consisting of more than 20 characters (the longer, the better).

Therefore, the password must always be typed using the standard US keyboard layout. However, it is important to note that you do NOT need a real US keyboard.

    <string lang="en" key="RESCUE_DISK_INFO">Before you can encrypt the partition/drive, you must create a TrueCrypt Rescue Disk (TRD), which serves the following purposes:\n\n- If the TrueCrypt Boot Loader, master key, or other critical data gets damaged, the TRD allows you to restore it and thus to regain access to your encrypted system and data.\n\n- If the TrueCrypt Boot Loader gets damaged or infected with malware, you can avoid running it by booting directly from the TRD.\n\n- If Windows gets damaged and cannot start, the TRD allows you to permanently decrypt the partition/drive before Windows starts.\n\n- The TRD will contain a backup of the present content of the first drive cylinder (which typically contains a system loader or boot manager) and will allow you to restore it if necessary.</string>

Note that this also applies to data that are overwritten with their encrypted form (which happens when TrueCrypt encrypts a system partition or drive). According to some studies and governmental publications, recovery of overwritten data can be prevented (or made very difficult) by overwritting the data with pseudorandom and certain non-random data a certain number of times. Therefore, if you believe that an adversary might be able to use techniques such as magnetic force microscopy to recover the data you intend encrypt, you may want to select one of the implemented wipe modes.</string>

Just press the Esc key on your keyboard (and if you have multiple systems, choose which to start). Then your Windows should start and TrueCrypt will automatically ask whether you want to uninstall the pre-boot authentication component.\n\n- If the previous steps do not help or if the TrueCrypt Boot Loader screen does not appear (before Windows starts), insert the TrueCrypt Rescue Disk into your CD/DVD drive and restart your computer. If the TrueCrypt Boot Loader screen does not appear, restart your computer, press F2 or Delete (as soon as you see a BIOS start-up screen), and then (when a BIOS configuration screen appears) configure your BIOS to boot from the CD/DVD drive first. Then restart your computer again. If the TrueCrypt Boot Loader screen appears, select 'Repair Options' > 'Restore original system loader'.

Therefore, before you start encrypting, please make sure that you have backup copies of the files you want to encrypt. If you do not, please back up the files now (you can click Defer, back up the files, then run TrueCrypt again anytime and it will automatically ask you whether you want to start encrypting).\n\nWhen ready, click Encrypt to start encrypting.</string>

    <string lang="en" key="RESCUE_DISK_HELP">\nIF POSSIBLE, PLEASE PRINT THIS TEXT (click 'Print' below).\n\n\nHow and When to Use TrueCrypt Rescue Disk (After Encrypting)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo use a TrueCrypt Rescue Disk, insert it into your CD/DVD drive and restart your computer. Note that TrueCrypt Rescue Disks contain the same TrueCrypt Boot Loader that normally resides in the first cylinder of a system drive. Therefore, when you boot from a TrueCrypt Rescue Disk, the standard TrueCrypt Boot Loader screen appears. The only difference between the regular TrueCrypt Boot Loader and the TrueCrypt Rescue Disk is that there are many more options available in the Repair Options menu (the regular TrueCrypt Boot Loader offers only the option 'Permanently decrypt system partition/drive'). If the TrueCrypt Boot Loader screen does not appear or if there are not all options available in the Repair Menu (see below), it is possible that your BIOS is configured to attempt to boot from hard drives before CD/DVD drives. If that is the case, restart your computer, press F2 or Delete (as soon as you see a BIOS start-up screen), and wait until a BIOS configuration screen appears. If no BIOS configuration screen appears, restart (reset) the computer again and start pressing F2 or Delete repeatedly as soon as you restart (reset) the computer. When a BIOS configuration screen appears, configure your BIOS to boot from the CD/DVD drive first (for information on how to do so, please refer to the documentation for your BIOS or motherboard). Then restart your computer. The TrueCrypt Boot Loader should be launched from the Rescue Disk now. To select Repair Options, press F8 on your keyboard.\n\n\n1) If the TrueCrypt Boot Loader screen does not appear after you start your computer, the TrueCrypt Boot Loader may be damaged. The TrueCrypt Rescue Disk allows you restore it and thus to regain access to your encrypted system and data. In the Rescue Disk screen, select 'Repair Options' > 'Restore TrueCrypt Boot Loader'. Then press 'Y' to confirm the action, remove the Rescue Disk from your CD/DVD drive and restart your computer.\n\n2) If the previous steps do not help, it is possible that the master key or other critical data are damaged. The TrueCrypt Rescue Disk allows you restore them and thus to regain access to your encrypted system and data. In the Rescue Disk screen, select 'Repair Options' > 'Restore key data'. Then enter your password, press 'Y' to confirm the action, remove the Rescue Disk from your CD/DVD drive, and restart your computer.\n\n3) If the TrueCrypt Boot Loader is damaged or infected with malware, you can avoid running it by booting directly from the TrueCrypt Rescue Disk. Insert your Rescue Disk into your CD/DVD drive and then enter your password in the Rescue Disk screen.\n\n4) If Windows is damaged and cannot start, the TrueCrypt Rescue Disk allows you to permanently decrypt the partition/drive before Windows starts. In the Rescue Disk screen, select 'Repair Options' > 'Permanently decrypt system partition/drive'. Then enter the correct password and wait until decryption is complete.</string>
