 * Sector encryption reworked to support plausible deniability
 * PKCS salt length increased to 64 bytes
 * Number of PKCS iterations increased to 2000
 * Blowfish uses 448-bit key
 * Random pool is rehashed after each byte added, not only when the pool is filled up
 * User password length limited to 64 characters to avoid HMAC SHA1 key hashing
 * Minimum required user password length increased to 12 characters
 * DES cipher removed from volume creation options
 * MD5 removed from PKCS5 PRF selection

   defrag on W2k/XP/2k3 and fixes system error (blue screen) during OS
   shutdown when volumes still mounted
