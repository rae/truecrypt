.SH DESCRIPTION
Manages encrypted TrueCrypt volumes, which can be mapped as virtual block
devices and used as any other standard block device. All data being read
from a mapped TrueCrypt volume is transparently decrypted and all data being
written to it is transparently encrypted.
.SH OPTIONS

VOLUME_PATH [MOUNT_DIRECTORY]
.IP
Open a TrueCrypt volume specified by VOLUME_PATH and map it as a block device
/dev/mapper/truecryptN. N is the first available device number if not
otherwise specified with \fB\-N\fR. To map a hidden volume, specify its password
and/or keyfiles (the outer volume cannot be mapped at the same time).
Filesystem of the mapped volume is mounted at MOUNT_DIRECTORY if specified.
See also options \fB\-\-display\-password\fR, \fB\-\-filesystem\fR, \fB\-k\fR, \fB\-M\fR, \fB\-p\fR, \fB\-P\fR,
\fB\-\-password\-tries\fR, \fB\-r\fR, \fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-update\-time\fR.
.PP
\fB\-\-backup\-headers\fR BACKUP_FILE [VOLUME_PATH]
.IP
Backup headers of a volume specified by VOLUME_PATH to a file BACKUP_FILE.
Volume path is requested from user if not specified on command line. Both
normal/outer and hidden volume headers are stored in the backup file even
if there is no hidden volume within the volume (to preserve plausible
deniability). When restoring the volume header, it is possible to select
which header is to be restored. Note that this command drops effective user
ID. See also \fB\-\-restore\-header\fR.
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-create\fR [VOLUME_PATH]
.IP
Create a new volume. Most options are requested from user if not specified
on command line. Hidden volume can be created only in an existing file or
device. Size of the hidden volume should not exceed the free space of the
filesystem on the outer volume. Hidden volume protection (see option \fB\-P\fR)
should be used to update the outer volume contents after the hidden volume
is created. Note that this command drops effective user ID.
See also options \fB\-\-cluster\fR, \fB\-\-disable\-progress\fR, \fB\-\-display\-keys\fR,
\fB\-\-encryption\fR, \fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-filesystem\fR, \fB\-\-hash\fR, \fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-quick\fR, \fB\-\-size\fR, \fB\-\-type\fR. Note
that passing some of the options may affect plausible deniability. See option
\fB\-p\fR for more information.
.PP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-change\fR [VOLUME_PATH]
.IP
Change a password and/or keyfile(s) of a volume. Volume path and passwords are
requested from user if not specified on command line. PKCS\-5 PRF HMAC hash
algorithm can be changed with option \fB\-\-hash\fR. See also options \fB\-k\fR,
\fB\-\-keyfile\-add\fR, \fB\-p\fR, \fB\-v\fR.
.PP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dismount\fR [MAPPED_VOLUME]
.IP
Dismount and unmap mapped volumes. If MAPPED_VOLUME is not specified, all
volumes are dismounted and unmapped. See below for a description of
MAPPED_VOLUME.
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Display help information.
.PP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR [MAPPED_VOLUME]
.IP
Display a list of mapped volumes. If MAPPED_VOLUME is not specified, all
volumes are listed. By default, the list contains only volume path and mapped
device name pairs. A more detailed list can be enabled by verbose output
option (\fB\-v\fR). See below for a description of MAPPED_VOLUME.
.PP
\fB\-\-keyfile\-create\fR FILE
.IP
Create a new keyfile using the random number generator. FILE argument specifies
the output file. Note that this command drops effective user ID.
.PP
\fB\-\-properties\fR [VOLUME_PATH]
.IP
Display properties of a volume specified by VOLUME_PATH.
.PP
\fB\-\-restore\-header\fR BACKUP_FILE [VOLUME_PATH]
.IP
Restore header of a volume specified by VOLUME_PATH from a file BACKUP_FILE.
Volume path is requested from user if not specified on command line.
Type of the restored volume header (normal/hidden) is requested from user if
not specified with \fB\-\-type\fR. Note that this command drops effective user ID.
See also \fB\-\-backup\-headers\fR.
.PP
\fB\-\-test\fR
.IP
Test all internal algorithms used in the process of encryption and decryption.
.PP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Display version information.
.PP
MAPPED_VOLUME
.IP
Specifies a mapped or mounted volume. One of the following forms can be used:
.IP
1) Path to the encrypted TrueCrypt volume.
.IP
2) Mount directory of the volume's filesystem (if mounted).
.IP
3) Device number of the mapped volume.
.IP
4) Device name of the mapped volume.
.PP
\fB\-\-cluster\fR SIZE
.IP
Use specified cluster size when creating a new volume. SIZE defines the number
of sectors per cluster.
.PP
\fB\-\-disable\-progress\fR
.IP
Disable display of progress information during creation of a new volume.
.PP
\fB\-\-display\-keys\fR
.IP
Display encryption keys generated during creation of a new volume.
.PP
\fB\-\-display\-password\fR
.IP
Display password characters while typing.
.PP
\fB\-\-encryption\fR EA
.IP
Use specified encryption algorithm when creating a new volume.
.PP
\fB\-\-filesystem\fR TYPE
.IP
Filesystem type to mount. The TYPE argument is passed to mount(8) command
with option \fB\-t\fR. Default type is 'auto'. When creating a new volume, this
option specifies the filesystem to be created on the new volume.
.PP
\fB\-\-hash\fR HASH
.IP
Use specified hash algorithm when creating a new volume or changing password
and/or keyfiles.
.PP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-keyfile\fR FILE | DIRECTORY
.IP
Use specified keyfile to open a volume to be mapped (or when changing password
and/or keyfiles). When a directory is specified, all files inside it will be
used (non\-recursively). Additional keyfiles can be specified with multiple \fB\-k\fR
options. See also option \fB\-K\fR.
.PP
\fB\-K\fR, \fB\-\-keyfile\-protected\fR FILE | DIRECTORY
.IP
Use specified keyfile to open a hidden volume to be protected. See also
options \fB\-k\fR and \fB\-P\fR.
.PP
\fB\-\-keyfile\-add\fR FILE | DIRECTORY
.IP
Add specified keyfile to a volume when changing its password and/or keyfiles.
This option must be also used to keep all previous keyfiles asigned to a
volume. See EXAMPLES for more information.
.PP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-mount\-options\fR OPTIONS
.IP
Filesystem mount options. The OPTIONS argument is passed to mount(8)
command with option \fB\-o\fR.
.PP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-device\-number\fR N
.IP
Use device number N when mapping a volume as a block device
/dev/mapper/truecryptN. Default is the first available device.
.PP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-password\fR PASSWORD
.IP
Use specified password to open a volume. Additional passwords can be
specified with multiple \fB\-p\fR options. An empty password can also be specified
("" in most shells). Note that passing a password on the command line is
potentially insecure as the password may be visible in the process list
(see ps(1)) and/or stored in a command history file.
.PP
\fB\-\-password\-tries\fR NUMBER
.IP
Prompt NUMBER of times for a password until the correct password is entered.
Default is to prompt three times.
.PP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-protect\-hidden\fR
.IP
Write\-protect a hidden volume when mapping an outer volume. Before mapping the
outer volume, the user will be prompted for a password to open the hidden
volume. The size and position of the hidden volume is then determined and the
outer volume is mapped with all sectors belonging to the hidden volume
protected against write operations. When a write to the protected area is
prevented, the whole volume is switched to read\-only mode. Verbose list command
(\fB\-vl\fR) can be used to query the state of the hidden volume protection. Warning
message is displayed when a volume switched to read\-only is being dismounted.
See also option \fB\-r\fR.
.PP
\fB\-\-quick\fR
.IP
Use quick format when creating a new volume. This option can be used only
when creating a device\-hosted volume. Quick format is always used when
creating a hidden volume.
.PP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-read\-only\fR
.IP
Map and mount a volume as read\-only. Write operations to the volume may not
fail immediately due to the write buffering performed by the system, but the
physical write will still be prevented.
.PP
\fB\-\-size\fR SIZE
.IP
Use specified size when creating a new volume. SIZE is defined as number of
bytes or, when a size suffix K/M/G is used, Kilobytes/Megabytes/Gigabytes.
Note that size must be a multiple of 512 bytes.
.PP
\fB\-\-type\fR TYPE
.IP
Use specified volume type when creating a new volume or restoring a volume
header. TYPE can be 'normal' or 'hidden'.
.PP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-user\-mount\fR
.IP
Set default user and group ID of the filesystem being mounted to the user and
group ID of the parent process. Some filesystems (like FAT) do not support
user permissions and, therefore, it is necessary to supply a default user and
group ID to the system when mounting such filesystems.
.PP
\fB\-\-update\-time\fR
.IP
Do not preserve access and modification timestamps of volume containers and
access timestamps of keyfiles. By default, timestamps are restored after
a volume is unmapped or after a keyfile is closed.
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.IP
Enable verbose output. Multiple \fB\-v\fR options can be specified to increase the
level of verbosity.
.SH EXAMPLES
