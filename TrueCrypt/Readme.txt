I. Windows
==========

Requirements for Building TrueCrypt for Windows:
------------------------------------------------

- Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 (version 7.1) or compatible
- Windows 2003 SP1 Driver Development Kit (build 3790.1830) or compatible


Instructions for Building TrueCrypt for Windows:
------------------------------------------------

1) Open 'Driver\Makefile' and change the 'DDK' variable to point to your
   Windows DDK directory
2) Open the 'TrueCrypt.sln' solution in Microsoft Visual Studio
3) Make sure 'All' is the active solution configuration
4) Build the solution
5) If successful, you should have a new TrueCrypt build in the 'Release' folder.



II. Linux
=========

Requirements for Building TrueCrypt for Linux:
----------------------------------------------

- Standard development tools: make, gcc, ld, strip

- Source code of the Linux kernel, version 2.6.5 or higher/compatible.
  The version of the kernel source code and its configuration must match the
  one under which you will be running TrueCrypt. Linux kernel sources are
  available at: http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/

- Linux kernel source code must be configured and all modules built
  (make config modules).  


Instructions for Building TrueCrypt for Linux:
----------------------------------------------

To build TrueCrypt execute the following commands:

cd Linux
./build.sh

The build script will first verify requirements for building TrueCrypt.
You may be prompted for additional information, which cannot be determined
automatically. Then the building process will start.


Installing TrueCrypt:
---------------------

To build and install TrueCrypt, execute the following commands:

cd Linux
./install.sh

The installation script will first verify requirements for running TrueCrypt.
If successful, you will be prompted for installation options. Afterwards, the
following files will be installed:

Kernel/truecrypt.ko
Cli/truecrypt
Cli/Man/truecrypt.1


Requirements for Running Truecrypt on Linux
-------------------------------------------

- Linux kernel version 2.6.5 or any higher/compatible version.
  
- Device mapper (dmsetup, http://sources.redhat.com/dm) and loop device
  (losetup) infrastructure, which are available in all major Linux
  distributions.
