This archive contains TrueCrypt 2.1a setup and documentation.


WHAT IS NEW IN TRUECRYPT 2.1a

Removed Features:

- IDEA encryption algorithm removed. This allows non-profit and profit
  organizations to use TrueCrypt without having to obtain a separate
  license for IDEA (according to the IDEA license, any use of software
  containing the IDEA algorithm by a non-profit or profit organization
  is considered as use for commercial purposes, and is subject to a
  license from MediaCrypt AG).

  Important: TrueCrypt volumes encrypted using the IDEA encryption
  algorithm cannot be mounted using TrueCrypt 2.1a. If you have such
  a volume, before upgrading to TrueCrypt 2.1a, please create a new
  TrueCrypt volume using a cipher other than IDEA and move your files
  to this new volume. We apologize for this inconvenience and any
  problems this may cause you.
