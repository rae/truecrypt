This is an independent implementation of the encryption algorithm:  
                                                                    
        Twofish by Bruce Schneier and colleagues                    
                                                                    
which is a candidate algorithm in the Advanced Encryption Standard  
programme of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. 
                                                                    
Copyright in this implementation is held by Dr B R Gladman but I    
hereby give permission for its free direct or derivative use subject
to acknowledgment of its origin and compliance with any conditions  
that the originators of the algorithm place on its exploitation.    
                                                                    
My thanks to Doug Whiting and Niels Ferguson for comments that led  
to improvements in this implementation.

Except as noted below copyright in this code is held by Dr B.R. Gladman 
but free direct or derivative use is permitted subject to acknowledgement
of its origin and subject to any constraints placed on the use of the 
algorithm by its designers (if such constraints may exist, this will be 
indicated below).

This is an implementation of Serpent, an encryption algorithm designed
by Anderson, Biham and Knudsen and submitted as a candidate for the 
Advanced Encryption Standard programme of the US National Institute of 
Standards and Technology.  

The designers of Serpent have not placed any constraints on the use of
this algorithm.
